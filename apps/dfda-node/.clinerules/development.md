- Use ts for data files
- Run `pnpm check` regularly and fix problems before moving to new features 
- Always search for existing libraries if possible instead of writing our own code. 
- just run non-destructive terminal commands without asking for permission first. 
- log errors with /lib/logger.ts. Don't ignore caught errors by prefixing with underscore
- avoid catching any errors.  throw Errors() instead so we can quickly identify the source of issues. 
- do not edit lib\database.types.ts. it's audomatically generated by pnpm run db:local:reset-types
- Modify the existing initial migration files in /supabase/migrations for database changes during this prototyping phase.
- do not create new migrations unless absolutely necessary
- add only one table, view, policy, etc. per migration
- name migrations like `{timestamp right after the last simimlar migration time so they're grouped}_{table|view|whatever}_{name of table, view, etc}.sql`
- Run pnpm run db:local:reset-types after making schema changes in the migration file.
