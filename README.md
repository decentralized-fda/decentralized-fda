# 💖 OBJECTIVE: MAXIMUM CURE ACCELERATION

Billions of people are suffering needlessly because the current system of clinical research, diagnosis, and treatment sucks because:

* ⏳ **Counterproductive Regulatory Barriers** to clinical research block life-saving treatments by 7-12 years
* 🚫 **97% of patients** are excluded from clinical trials
* 💰 **Drug development costs** of $2.6B are passed on to patients
* ⏱️ **Terminal patients** wait 4+ years for breakthrough therapy approvals
* 📊 The system ignores **real-world evidence** about effective treatments

## 💡 The Solution

The Cure Acceleration Act creates:

* ✅ **Universal Trial Access** - Every person's right to try safe treatments
* 🤖 **Decentralized Autonomous FDA** - Free, open infrastructure for real-world evidence collection
* 🏆 **50/50 Health Savings Sharing Rewards** - Multi-billion dollar incentives for developing actual cures instead of lifetime drug subscriptions
* 📈 **Real-Time Analysis** of the positive and negative effects of every food, supplement, drug, and treatment on every measurable aspect of human health and happiness
* 🌐 **Global Access** - Decentralized trials anyone can participate in from home

# 😕 Why are we doing this?

The current system of clinical research, diagnosis, and treatment is failing the billions of people are suffering from chronic diseases.

# 🧪 Our Hypothesis

By harnessing global collective intelligence and oceans of real-world data, we hope to emulate Wikipedia's speed of knowledge generation.

<!--suppress CheckImageSize, HtmlDeprecatedAttribute -->
<details>
  <summary>👉 How to generate discoveries 50X faster and 1000X cheaper than current systems...</summary>

## Global Scale Clinical Research + Collective Intelligence = 🤯

So in the 90's, Microsoft spent billions hiring thousands of PhDs to create Encarta, the greatest encyclopedia in history.  A decade later, when Wikipedia was created, the general consensus was that it was going to be a dumpster fire of lies.  Surprisingly, Wikipedia ended up generating information 50X faster than Encarta and was about 1000X cheaper without any loss in accuracy.  This is the magical power of crowdsourcing and open collaboration.

Our crazy theory is that we can accomplish the same great feat in the realm of clinical research.  By crowdsourcing real-world data and observations from patients, clinicians, and researchers, we hope to generate clinical discoveries 50X faster and 1000X cheaper than current systems.

## The Potential of Real-World Evidence-Based Studies

- **Diagnostics** - Data mining and analysis to identify causes of illness
- **Preventative medicine** - Predictive analytics and data analysis of genetic, lifestyle, and social circumstances
  to prevent disease
- **Precision medicine** - Leveraging aggregate data to drive hyper-personalized care
- **Medical research** - Data-driven medical and pharmacological research to cure disease and discover new treatments and medicines
- **Reduction of adverse medication events** - Harnessing of big data to spot medication errors and flag potential
  adverse reactions
- **Cost reduction** - Identification of value that drives better patient outcomes for long-term savings
- **Population health** - Monitor big data to identify disease trends and health strategies based on demographics,
  geography, and socioeconomic

### Data Analysis

The Analytics Engine performs temporal precedence accounting, longitudinal data aggregation, erroneous data filtering, unit conversions, ingredient tagging, and variable grouping to quantify correlations between symptoms, treatments, and other factors.

It then pairs every combination of variables and identifies likely causal relationships using correlation mining algorithms in conjunction with a pharmacokinetic model.  The algorithms first identify the onset delay and duration of action for each hypothetical factor. It then identifies the optimal daily values for each factor.
