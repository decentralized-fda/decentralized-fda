Traditional drug development takes an average of 15 years from initial research to patient availability. Through automation of administrative tasks, AI-assisted protocol development, and decentralized trial management, we can dramatically compress this timeline:

- Protocol Development: 2 months (vs 2 years)
- Patient Recruitment: 1 month (vs 2 years)
- Trial Execution: 6 months (vs 3 years)
- Data Analysis: 1 month (vs 1 year)
- Regulatory Review: 5 months (vs 2 years)

This 12x acceleration means potentially life-saving treatments reach patients faster while maintaining rigorous safety standards through automated monitoring and real-time data analysis.
