Traditional clinical trials cost an average of $41,413 per participant, making large-scale research prohibitively expensive. Our system reduces this to $1,500 per participant through:

- Elimination of physical site costs
- Automated data collection and verification
- AI-driven patient monitoring and safety checks
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Integration with existing healthcare infrastructure

This 96% cost reduction means research institutions can run larger trials with more diverse participants, leading to more robust and representative results.
