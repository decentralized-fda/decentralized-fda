Traditional clinical trials exclude up to 85% of willing participants due to strict eligibility criteria and geographical limitations. Our decentralized approach removes these barriers by:

- Enabling participation from any location through remote monitoring
- Including patients with multiple conditions or medications
- Supporting diverse populations through automated translation and cultural adaptation
- Allowing participation while maintaining regular treatment regimens
- Reducing the burden of in-person visits

This increased inclusivity means trial results better represent real-world patients, leading to more accurate and applicable treatment data.
