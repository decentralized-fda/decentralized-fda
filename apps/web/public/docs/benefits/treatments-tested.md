With 166 billion potential treatments waiting to be tested and only 21,000 compounds studied so far, we're barely scratching the surface of possible cures. Our system accelerates this discovery process by:

- Running parallel trials across multiple treatment candidates
- Automating protocol generation and approval processes
- Using AI to identify promising treatment combinations
- Leveraging real-world data to validate effectiveness
- Reducing administrative overhead to focus on science

This massive increase in testing capacity means we can explore more potential cures in one year than traditional methods could test in over a century.
