- Use pnpm: Use pnpm for all package management commands (pnpm install, pnpm build, etc.). 
- Run pnpm check: Frequently run pnpm check (lint --fix and type check) and fix errors immediately.

- Unused Variable Handling: Analyze unused variables. Use them if needed, otherwise delete or prefix with _.
- Default to Server Components: Keep Next.js pages as Server Components by default. Extract client logic to separate components using 'use client'.
- Use Custom Logger: Use the logger from lib/logger.ts for errors instead of console.error.
- Root Lib/Components: Place library code in /lib and components in /components at the root level, not inside /app.

- Prioritize using generated types from lib/database.types.ts over creating new ones.
- Run pnpm run db:local:reset-types after making schema changes in the migration file.
- one table/view, etc per migration and prefix the word part with the type like table_, view_, etc.
