# Link Validator

A robust link validation library for JavaScript/TypeScript projects that checks URLs in various file types including Markdown, JSX/TSX, and TypeScript/JavaScript files.

## Features

- üîç **Multi-Format Support**: Validates URLs in MD, MDX, TS, TSX, JS, and JSX files
- üåê **External Link Validation**: Verifies that external URLs are accessible
- üìÅ **Local Link Validation**: Ensures internal file references are valid
- ‚ö° **Performance Optimized**: Includes caching for faster repeated checks
- üéØ **Configurable**: Customize file patterns, exclusions, and validation rules
- üìä **Detailed Reporting**: Get precise link locations and error information
- üîí **Type-Safe**: Written in TypeScript with full type definitions

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Overview
A TypeScript-based link validation tool that scans GitHub projects for links, maintains a configuration file of link statuses, and optimizes validation through intelligent caching and failure tracking.

### Core Requirements

1. **Project Scanning**
   - Scan all supported file types in a GitHub project
   - Support for MD, MDX, TS, TSX, JS, and JSX files
   - Extract both external and internal links

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Generate `link-validator.config.json` in project root
   - Store successful and failed external links
   - Track last validation timestamp for each link
   - Auto-cleanup of non-existent links

3. **Link Validation**
   - Validate external links with proper HTTP checks
   - Skip previously failed links
   - Limit external link checks to once per day
   - Support for timeout and rate limiting

### Technical Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Efficient file traversal
   - Caching of validation results
   - Parallel link validation where appropriate

2. **Dependencies**
   - Use established libraries for:
     - File system operations
     - HTTP requests
     - Link parsing
     - Config file management

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for full workflow
   - Mock HTTP responses for testing

      "error": "404 Not Found",
      "locations": ["path/to/file3.md"]
    }
  }
