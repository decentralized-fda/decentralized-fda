      content: `# Time to Treatment is Too Long üìÖ

The current clinical trial process takes far too long, causing unnecessary suffering and death. Here's why:

## Current Timeline: [17 Years](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241518/) Average
- Protocol Development: 2 years
- Site Selection: 1 year
- Patient Recruitment: 2 years
- Trial Duration: 3 years
- Data Analysis: 1 year
- FDA Review: 2 years
- Post-Market Studies: 6 years

## Key Problems
- Each phase requires extensive paperwork and bureaucracy
- Site selection and setup is time consuming
- Patient recruitment is slow and difficult
- Data collection and verification takes too long
- Review process has many delays
- Post-market studies drag on for years

## Impact
- Patients suffer and die waiting for treatments
- Researchers waste time on administrative tasks
- Promising treatments are abandoned due to delays
- Innovation is stifled by long timelines
- Healthcare costs increase due to inefficiency`

The DFDA enables a much faster path to treatment while maintaining safety:

## New Timeline: 2 Years Average
- Protocol Development: 2 months (AI-assisted)
- Patient Recruitment: 1 month (direct-to-patient)
- Trial Duration: 6 months (real-world data)
- Data Analysis: 1 month (automated)
- Review Process: 5 months (continuous)
- Post-Market: Ongoing monitoring

## Key Improvements
- AI-assisted protocol development
- Direct patient recruitment
- Real-world data collection
- Automated analysis
- Continuous review process
- Real-time safety monitoring

## Benefits
- Faster access to treatments
- Reduced patient suffering
- More efficient use of resources
- Increased innovation
- Lower healthcare costs
- Better safety monitoring`

      content: `# Clinical Research is Too Expensive üí∞

The current clinical trial process is prohibitively expensive, limiting innovation and access to treatments.

## Current Costs: [$57M Average Per Trial](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-barriers-drug-development-0)
- Site Costs: $7.4M
- Staff Costs: $4.3M
- Administrative: $7.2M
- Other Costs: $38.1M

## Key Cost Drivers
- Multiple physical trial sites
- Large administrative staff
- Complex paperwork requirements
- Lengthy timelines
- High patient recruitment costs
- Expensive data collection

## Impact
- Many promising treatments never get tested
- Small patient populations are ignored
- Innovation is limited to large companies
- Healthcare costs are inflated
- Research focuses on profitable areas only

Current clinical trials exclude most patients, leading to poor real-world results.

## Current Exclusions
- 60% excluded due to location
- 45% excluded by strict criteria
- 30% excluded by scheduling
- 25% excluded by language
- Only 15% can participate

## Key Problems
- Geographic limitations
- Strict inclusion criteria
- Rigid scheduling
- Language barriers
- Transportation issues
- Work conflicts
- Childcare needs

## Impact
- Results don't reflect reality
- Many patients can't access trials
- Treatments may not work as expected
- Health disparities increase
- Innovation is limited
