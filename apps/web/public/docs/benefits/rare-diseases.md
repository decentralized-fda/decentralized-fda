Currently, 95% of rare diseases have no FDA-approved treatments, affecting millions of patients worldwide. Our decentralized approach makes rare disease research viable by:

- Reducing per-trial costs by 96%
- Finding and connecting rare disease patients globally
- Enabling smaller, more efficient trial cohorts
- Automating patient monitoring and data collection
- Accelerating the treatment development timeline

This means we could test potential treatments for thousands of currently neglected rare diseases within a decade, giving hope to millions of patients who currently have no treatment options.
