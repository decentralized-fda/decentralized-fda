# Disease Cure Analysis Report

## Summary
Based on current drug development rates and historical data, this analysis provides insights into future disease cure timelines. The last major disease cure was 45 years ago in 1980.

## Key Statistics
- Probability of curing a random disease: 2.50% per year
  - Best case: 3.00%
  - Worst case: 2.00%
- Expected time until next cure: 55.0 years
  - Best case: 44.0 years
  - Worst case: 82.5 years
- Diseases per approved drug: 40.0
- Years since last major cure: 45

## Current Parameters
- Drugs Approved Per Year: 50
- Total Diseases Needing Cures: 2000
- Development to Access Time: 15 years

## Calculation Details
- Cure Probability: Calculated by dividing annual drug approvals (50) by total diseases (2000)
- Expected Cure Time: Inverse of cure probability (40.0 years) plus development time (15 years)
- Note: These calculations currently assume each drug targets one disease. In reality, some drugs may treat multiple conditions.

## Methodology & Assumptions
1. Cure probability calculated using ratio of annual drug approvals to total diseases
2. Expected cure time accounts for both probability and development timeline
3. Sensitivity analysis considers:
   - Variations in drug approval success rates (Â±20%)
   - Potential development time fluctuations (-20%/+50%)
   - Multi-disease treatment potential
4. Key assumptions:
   - Linear relationship between drug approvals and cures
   - Uniform distribution of disease complexity
   - Consistent drug development timelines

## Implications
At current rates, we can expect the next disease cure between 2069 (best case) and 2108 (worst case). This timeline could be shortened through:
- Increased drug approval rates
- Reduced development and access times
- More efficient targeting of research efforts
- Development of multi-disease treatment approaches
