- Modify the existing initial migration files in /supabase/migrations for database changes during this prototyping phase.
- do not create new migrations unless absolutely necessary
- add only one table, view, policy, etc. per migration
- name migrations like `{timestamp right after the last simimlar migration time so they're grouped}_{table|view|whatever}_{name of table, view, etc}.sql`
- Run pnpm run db:local:reset-types after making schema changes in the migration file.
