- Run `pnpm check` regularly and fix errors (just run, don't ask for permission)
- Use server actions whenever possible instead of api routes
- Use Custom Logger: Use the logger from lib/logger.ts for errors instead of console.error
- Root Lib/Components: Place library code in /lib and components in /components at the root level, not inside /app
- Prioritize using generated types from lib/database.types.ts over creating new ones
- Use server components whenever possible and always for pages
- don't create new interfaces, use @lib/database.types.ts

# PowerShell Commands
- Use `Remove-Item` instead of `del` or `rm` for file operations
- Always quote file paths: `Remove-Item -Path "file1.txt","file2.txt"`
- For directory operations, use `Set-Location` (or `cd`) with quoted paths
- For renaming files, use `Rename-Item` instead of `ren` or `mv`
- When moving between directories, use `cd ..` to go up one level
- Avoid chaining commands with `&&` in PowerShell, use separate commands instead
