- Run `pnpm check` regularly and fix errors (just run, don't ask for permission)
- Use server actions whenever possible instead of api routes
- Use Custom Logger: Use the logger from lib/logger.ts for errors instead of console.error
- Root Lib/Components: Place library code in /lib and components in /components at the root level, not inside /app
- Prioritize using generated types from lib/database.types.ts over creating new ones
- Use server components whenever possible and always for pages
- don't create new interfaces, use @lib/database.types.ts
