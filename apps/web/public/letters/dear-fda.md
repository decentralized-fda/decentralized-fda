Dear Nations of the World,

Every 4 seconds, someone dies from a chronic disease. With over 2 billion people affected worldwide and more than 2,000 diseases still without cures, our current healthcare systems are failing to keep pace with human suffering. The staggering $2.4 billion cost to develop a single treatment creates an impossible burden - one that leaves patients waiting years for life-saving therapies while facing unaffordable prices even when treatments become available.

# The problem

Consider these realities:
- 1 in 3 families face financial ruin from medical expenses
- The average time from drug discovery to patient access is 12 years
- 95% of experimental drugs fail in clinical trials, wasting precious resources

# The solution: Upgrading FDA.gov

1. Patient Rights

Patients who are suffering from a chronic disease have the right to participate in decentralized clinical trials for treatments that have been proven to be safe.  No institution

2. Automating and Decentralizing the Clinical Trial Process

We propose a global decentralized autonomous clinical trial network that could:
- Reduce treatment development costs by 90% through automation, shared infrastructure, and AI-assisted trial design
- Cut development timelines from 12 years to 4-5 years by streamlining regulatory processes and enabling real-time data sharing
- Make effective treatments 5-10x more affordable by reducing development costs and eliminating redundant trials
- Provide far more comprehensive and quantitative information on the positive and negative effects of each treatment

# How it works

This system would create a unified global platform where patients could:

1. A ranked list of all potential treatments for their condition, based on comparative effectiveness.
2. The ability to join clinical trials with a single click, especially if their current treatments are inadequate.
3. Comprehensive and quantitative information on the positive and negative effects of each treatment.
4. Seamless options to send approved treatments to their pharmacy or physician, schedule necessary lab tests, and report outcomes.

Patients could effortlessly report positive and negative effects through the website, forms, or automated systems like robocalls. This data would continuously improve the effectiveness rankings of treatments, ensuring the system evolves and adapts based on real-world evidence.


Let us work together to build a future where no one suffers or dies waiting for treatments they need and deserve.
