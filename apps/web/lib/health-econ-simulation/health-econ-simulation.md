# Health Econ Simulation Modeler

## Overview

The Health Econ Simulation Modeler is a tool for simulating health economic outcomes of interventions. 


## Features

Here are the outputs you need in a health economic simulation for a given intervention:

1. **Healthcare Cost Savings**  
   - Reduced spending on disease treatment and management.  
   - Changes in Medicare/Medicaid expenditures.

2. **Population-Level Benefit**  
   - Number of cases prevented (e.g., Alzheimer’s, obesity-related conditions).  
   - Changes in mortality rates.  
   - Life years gained (LYG).

3. **Quality of Life**  
   - Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or similar metrics.  
   - Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) scores, if available.

4. **Productivity Impact**  
   - GDP gains from extended working years.  
   - Reduced absenteeism and disability.

5. **Cost-Effectiveness Ratios**  
   - Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).  
   - Return on investment (ROI) estimates.

6. **Budget Impact**  
   - Upfront costs of intervention (research, manufacturing, distribution).  
   - Long-term savings or costs over a defined time horizon (5–10 years or longer).

7. **Sensitivity and Scenario Analyses**  
   - Best-/worst-case cost assumptions.  
   - Uptake rates and adherence variations.

8. **Sub-Population Analysis**  
   - Differences by age group, comorbidities, or socioeconomic status.

Keep each of these outputs visible and easy to understand. This will help stakeholders see the full economic and health impact.
