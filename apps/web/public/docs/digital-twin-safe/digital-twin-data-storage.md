# Digital Twin Data Storage and Indexing

The application should create a private GitHub repository for each user to store their digital twin data. This repository will be used to store the user's digital twin data, which will be used by the digital twin agents to simulate the user's behavior and preferences.

The main benefits of using GitHub as the data storage solution are:

- Version control: GitHub provides version control features that allow the user to track changes to their data over time.
- Security: GitHub repositories are private by default, ensuring that the user's data is secure and only accessible to the user and the application's digital twin agents.
- Collaboration: GitHub repositories can be shared with other users, allowing for collaboration on digital twin data.
- Openness: GitHub repositories are open by default, allowing the user to easily access and export their data.
- Portability: GitHub repositories can be easily cloned and used in other systems without the need for complex API integrations.
- Automation: GitHub repositories can be integrated with GitHub Actions to automate data processing tasks, such as updating vector database embeddings when data is added or changed.
- Integration: GitHub repositories can be integrated with other tools and services, such as data visualization tools, machine learning models, and analytics platforms.
- Scalability: GitHub repositories can scale to accommodate large amounts of data, making them suitable for storing complex digital twin data.
- Flexibility: GitHub repositories can store different types of data, such as text, images, videos, and other multimedia content.

## Requirements

The repository should be created automatically when the user signs up for the application.
The user should be able to access the repository through the application's interface,
where they can view and manage their digital twin data.

The repository should be private to ensure the user's data is secure and only accessible to the user and the application's digital twin agents.

The repository should be structured to store different types of data, such as personal profiles, behavioral data, social data, health information, goals, resource access, time availability, geographical data, cultural information, and communication preferences.

## Implementation

The application should use the GitHub API to create and manage the user's repository.
When the user signs up for the application, the application should create a private repository for the user and grant the user access to the repository.

The application should provide an interface for the user to view and manage their digital twin data stored in the repository.

## Updating Vector Embeddings

The application should use GitHub Actions to automatically update vector database embeddings when the user's data is added or changed in the repository.

The application should define a workflow that triggers the vector database update process when the user's data is updated in the repository.

The application should use the updated vector embeddings to improve the accuracy of the digital twin agents' simulations of the user's behavior and preferences.

## OpenAI API Key Management

The application should securely store and manage the user's OpenAI API key to access the OpenAI API for natural language processing tasks.

So we need an interface for the user to enter and manage their OpenAI API key in the application.
