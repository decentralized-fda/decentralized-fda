# Link Validator Development Workflow

## Feature Development Cycle

1. **Before Starting a New Feature**
   - Identify the feature from README.md checklist
   - Create a new test file for the feature
   - Write failing tests first

2. **During Development**
   - Implement the feature
   - Run type checks: `npm run type-check`
   - Run tests: `npm test`
   - Fix any type or test issues before proceeding

3. **After Feature Completion**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update README.md checklist
     - Mark feature as completed: `- [x]`
     - Mark associated tests as completed
   - Commit changes with format: `feat(scope): description`

4. **Quality Gates**
   - All TypeScript types must be explicit (no `any`)
   - Test coverage must be maintained
   - README checklist must be updated
   - Config file schema must be maintained

## Checklist Template

```markdown
### Feature Implementation
- [ ] Write failing tests
- [ ] Implement feature
- [ ] Pass type checks
- [ ] Pass all tests
- [ ] Update README checklist
- [ ] Commit changes
```

## Notes
- Never move to a new feature until current feature is fully tested
- Keep README.md checklist as single source of truth for progress
- Always run tests before committing
- Document any config file schema changes
