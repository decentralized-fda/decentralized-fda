Dear Leaders of Global Health,

Every 4 seconds, someone dies from a chronic disease. With over 2 billion people affected worldwide and more than 2,000 diseases still without cures, our current healthcare systems are failing to keep pace with human suffering. The staggering $2.4 billion cost to develop a single treatment creates an impossible burden - one that leaves patients waiting years for life-saving therapies while facing unaffordable prices even when treatments become available.

Consider these realities:
- 1 in 3 families face financial ruin from medical expenses
- The average time from drug discovery to patient access is 12 years
- 95% of experimental drugs fail in clinical trials, wasting precious resources

We propose an urgent transformation - a Global Treatment Acceleration System (GTAS) that could:
- Reduce treatment development costs by 90% through automation, shared infrastructure, and AI-assisted trial design (based on Johns Hopkins and CBO studies)
- Cut development timelines from 12 years to 4-5 years by streamlining regulatory processes and enabling real-time data sharing
- Make effective treatments 5-10x more affordable by reducing development costs and eliminating redundant trials

This system would create a unified global platform where patients could:

1. A ranked list of all potential treatments for their condition, based on comparative effectiveness.
2. The ability to join clinical trials with a single click, especially if their current treatments are inadequate.
3. Comprehensive and quantitative information on the positive and negative effects of each treatment.
4. Seamless options to send approved treatments to their pharmacy or physician, schedule necessary lab tests, and report outcomes.

Patients could effortlessly report positive and negative effects through the website, forms, or automated systems like robocalls. This data would continuously improve the effectiveness rankings of treatments, ensuring the system evolves and adapts based on real-world evidence.

The Global Treatment Acceleration System represents a historic opportunity to transform healthcare delivery. Based on economic modeling from Johns Hopkins, CBO, and JAMA studies, we estimate:
- Initial investment: $100-150 million for prototype development
- Development timeline: 24 months for initial prototype
- Ongoing costs: $1-2 per person annually across participating nations
These investments could yield trillions in healthcare savings while making treatments accessible to all.

We propose a three-phase implementation:
1. Pilot Phase (24 months): Develop core platform with 3 key disease areas
2. Expansion Phase (4 years): Scale to cover 30% of major diseases
3. Global Rollout (7 years): Full implementation across all disease areas

The time to act is now. Every day we delay, thousands more lives are lost to treatable conditions. We urge you to join us in creating this transformative system that will:
- Save millions of lives annually
- Make effective treatments accessible to all
- Create a new era of data-driven, patient-centered healthcare
- Establish a global standard for medical innovation

Let us work together to build a future where no one suffers or dies waiting for treatments they need and deserve.
