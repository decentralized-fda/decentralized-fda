description: designing database schema or creating migrations

## 🎯 **Goals:**
- Create initial schema for decentralized FDA. Don't worry about migrations. This is the initial schema
- Don't prefix files or folders with numbers
- Make sure each table and view is stored in its own SQL file. Do not put multiple tables or views in the same sql file
- Explicitly clear, intuitive, self-documenting naming conventions.
- Zero data duplication; simplest possible row-level security (RLS).
- Explicitly unified treatments/outcomes as **variables**.
- Explicitly unified numeric time-series data as **measurements**.
- No ambiguous prefixes (`user_`) in naming.
- Intermediate relational tables explicitly named by ownership relationship (`parent_child`).
- Avoid overly complex or overloaded schemas.
- Migration folder names must explicitly match schema names (e.g., migrations/150_global = global schema).

## 🗂️ **Schema Structure**

```
 migrations/
    ├── reference/          # schema = reference
        ├── variables
        ├── variables_synonyms
        └── units_of_measurement
    ├── global/            # schema = global
        ├── treatment_rankings
        └── variable_global_stats
    ├── cohort/           # schema = cohort
        ├── trials
        ├── trial_phases
        ├── protocols
        ├── outcomes
        ├── trials_participants
        ├── protocols_variables
        └── variable_group_stats
    ├── personal/         # schema = personal
        ├── trials
        ├── trial_phases
        ├── measurements
        ├── users_variables (with minimal user settings)
        └── variable_user_stats
    ├── core/            # schema = core
        ├── users
        ├── audit_logs
        ├── permissions
        ├── groups_users
        └── permissions_users
    └── commerce/        # schema = commerce
        ├── orders
        ├── inventory
        ├── orders_products
        └── shipments_orders
```

## 📋 **Checklist**

Verify explicitly for every new table/view:

✅ Schema explicitly selected from decision tree.  
✅ Table or view explicitly chosen.  
✅ naming without prefixes explicitly followed.  
✅ `[parent_child]` relational table naming explicitly used.  
✅ Unified variable & measurement handling.  
✅ Explicitly simplify user variable settings (within relational or dedicated table).  
✅ Explicitly enforce default units explicitly.  
✅ RLS explicitly clear and simple.
✅ Migration folder name explicitly matches schema name.
