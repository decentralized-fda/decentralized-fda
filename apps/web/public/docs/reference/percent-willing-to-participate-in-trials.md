# 90% of Willing Patients Do Not Participate in Clinical Trials

A significant gap exists between the number of patients willing to participate in clinical trials and those who actually do. Studies indicate that while 68% of patients express interest in participating, only 9% report being invited to a clinical trial.

**Barriers to Participation**

Several obstacles prevent willing patients from enrolling in clinical trials:

- **Lack of Awareness**: Many patients are unaware of available clinical trials relevant to their condition. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2664601/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

- **Geographical Constraints**: Travel distance to trial sites is a significant barrier, especially for patients in rural or underserved areas. ([mdgroup.com](https://mdgroup.com/blog/distance-a-key-barrier-to-clinical-trial-access-decentralized-and-hybrid-trials/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

- **Eligibility Criteria**: Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria can limit patient participation.

- **Financial Burden**: Costs associated with travel, accommodation, and time off work can deter patients. ([skyelarke.com](https://www.skyelarke.com/breaking-down-barriers-to-clinical-trial-participation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Solutions Through a Global Automated Decentralized FDA Trial Platform**

Implementing a global automated decentralized clinical trial platform and database can address these barriers:

- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Decentralized trials utilize remote monitoring and data collection, reducing the need for physical site visits and making participation feasible for a broader population. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10465321/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

- **Improved Awareness**: A centralized database can inform patients and healthcare providers about ongoing trials, increasing awareness and enrollment.

- **Flexible Participation**: Remote data collection allows patients to participate without the constraints of location, reducing geographical and financial barriers.

By leveraging such a platform, we can bridge the gap between patient willingness and actual participation, making clinical trials more inclusive and efficient.
