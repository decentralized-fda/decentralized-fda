# Storing Rules
We will create a rule file in which to store instructions (essentially, our “memory”).
## Location
.cursor/rules/
## File Name
Use a name composed of letters, digits, and hyphens.
## File Extension
mdc
## Content
The content is stored in a code block. The frontmatter changes depending on the rule type:
```
description:
globs:
alwaysApply:
```
## Rule Title
Provide the rule content in proper Markdown format.
## Rule Types
Rules can have the following types. Choose the one that best fits your needs:
Always: Always applied.
Auto Attached: Automatically applied to files matching specified globs.
Agent Requested: Applied only when an agent decides it’s relevant, based on the description.
Manual: Applied only when the user explicitly says so.
## Frontmatter Details
The frontmatter differs based on the rule type. Include the proper fields:
### Always
```
globs: *
```
### Auto Attached
Leave description blank. Include globs. If you specify multiple globs, separate them with commas:
```
description:
globs: comma-separated globs
```
### Agent Requested
Include a description. Do not include globs; otherwise, it becomes Auto Attached:
```
description: Put your description here
globs:
alwaysApply: false
```
### Manual
Leave description and globs empty. Set alwaysApply to false:
```
description:
globs:
alwaysApply: false
```
## Reporting After Creation
Once you create your rule file, report:
  - Which rule type you chose and why
  - An explanation of the rule’s content
